## Option 1: Use the original backup
 
If you have the original backup of the PLC program, you can use it to edit, change or remove the old password from the hardware configuration. You can do this by opening the backup file in Simatic Manager and going to Options > Set PG/PC Interface. Then, select your communication interface and click OK. Next, go to PLC > Download and choose Hardware Configuration. You will be prompted to enter the password. If you don't know it, you can click on Edit > Change Password and enter a new one. Then, you can download the hardware configuration to the PLC and access it with the new password.
 
## Option 2: Clear the PLC memory
 
If you don't have the original backup or you don't care about losing the existing program, you can clear the PLC memory and download a new program. To do this, you need to put the CPU in stop mode and use a memory card (MMC) that is not locked with a password. You can either use a new MMC or format an old one using Simatic Manager. Then, insert the MMC into the CPU slot and turn on the PLC. The CPU will automatically copy the data from the MMC to its internal memory and erase the password. You can then connect to the PLC using Simatic Manager and download a new program.
 
## Option 3: Contact Siemens support
 
If none of the above options work for you or you need more assistance, you can contact Siemens support and ask for help. They might be able to provide you with some tools or services that can unlock your PLC without deleting the program. However, this might require some proof of ownership or authorization from Siemens.
