Diablo 2 Reloaded is a repack of the classic action RPG game Diablo 2 and its expansion Lord of Destruction. However, some users have reported that the game files are password protected and they cannot access them without completing surveys or visiting dubious websites. In this article, we will show you how to crack Diablo 2 Reloaded password and enjoy the game without any hassle.
 
First of all, you need to know that Diablo 2 Reloaded is not an official release by Blizzard Entertainment or any other authorized publisher. It is a fan-made modification that may contain malware, viruses, or other unwanted programs. Therefore, we do not recommend downloading or installing it from any untrusted source. If you want to play Diablo 2 legally and safely, you can buy it from [here](https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo_ii_resurrected).

However, if you have already downloaded Diablo 2 Reloaded and want to crack its password, you can try the following methods:
 
- Method 1: Use ZLOE version. ZLOE is a group of hackers who have managed to bypass the online verification of Diablo 2 Resurrected, which is the remastered version of Diablo 2. They have released a cracked version of the game that works offline and online with other ZLOE users. You can find their version on [Skidrow & Reloaded Games](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-v1-0-66063-zloe/). To play it, you need to register on [ZLOEMU](https://zloemu.net/reg), download [ZClient](https://zloemu.net/files/ZClient.exe), and drag and drop D2R.exe to ZClient window. This method does not require any password.
- Method 2: Use EMU version. EMU is another group of hackers who have created an emulator that allows you to play Diablo 2 Resurrected on PC. They have also released a cracked version of the game that works offline only. You can find their version on [Skidrow & Reloaded Games](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-v1-0-0-2-emu/). To play it, you need to mount the iso file, install the game, and run it. This method does not require any password either.
- Method 3: Use brute force or dictionary attack. This is the most difficult and risky method, as it involves trying different combinations of characters or words until you find the correct password. You need to use a software like [RAR Password Cracker](https://www.rarpasswordcracker.com/) or [WinRAR Password Remover](https://www.winrarpasswordremover.net/) to perform this task. However, this method may take a long time, depending on the complexity of the password and your computer speed. It may also damage your files or expose your system to malware.

We hope this article has helped you crack Diablo 2 Reloaded password and enjoy the game. However, we remind you again that this is an unofficial and potentially harmful release that may violate Blizzard's terms of service and intellectual property rights. Therefore, we advise you to play Diablo 2 legally and safely by purchasing it from [here](https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo_ii_resurrected).
