- Rugged housing: The scanner is built to withstand harsh environments and rough handling. It can resist drops of up to 1.8 meters (6 feet) to concrete, and has an IP41 rating for protection against dust and water.

- Automatic stand detection: The scanner can automatically switch between handheld and presentation mode when placed in or removed from the stand. This allows you to scan barcodes hands-free or on-the-go, depending on your preference.
