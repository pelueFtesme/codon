You can also switch between different views of the timeline by clicking on the icons on the bottom left corner.
 
## Step 3: Add Effects, Transitions, Titles, and Music
 
Now comes the fun part: adding effects, transitions, titles, and music to your videos. You can do this by clicking on the "Effects", "Transitions", "Titles", or "Music" tabs on the left side of the screen. You will see a variety of options that you can apply to your videos by dragging and dropping them onto the timeline. You can also adjust the settings of each effect, transition, title, or music by double-clicking on them on the timeline.
 
Some of the effects that you can add to your videos include color correction, brightness and contrast, stabilization, slow motion, fast motion, reverse playback, picture-in-picture, chroma keying (green screen), and artistic filters. Some of the transitions that you can use to connect your videos include fades, wipes, slides, spins, flips, and 3D effects. Some of the titles that you can add to your videos include animated text, lower thirds, credits, subtitles, and logos. Some of the music that you can add to your videos include soundtracks, sound effects, voice-overs, and songs from your own collection.
 
## Step 4: Export or Burn Your Videos
 
Once you are happy with your video editing project, you can export or burn it to a desired format or device. You can do this by clicking on the "Export" tab and choosing one of the options. You can export your videos as a file (MP4, AVI, WMV, MOV, etc.), as a disc (DVD or Blu-ray), or as an online video (YouTube or Facebook). You can also choose a preset for different devices (smartphones, tablets, TVs, etc.) or customize your own settings (resolution, frame rate, bitrate, etc.).
 
If you choose to export your videos as a file or an online video, you will see a preview window where you can check your video before saving it. You can also trim or crop your video if needed. If you choose to export your videos as a disc, you will see a menu editor where you can create a professional-looking menu for your disc.
