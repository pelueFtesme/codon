In this article, we will show you how to use the 3D camera tracker effect in After Effects CC and some tips and tricks to get the best results.
 
## Step 1: Apply the 3D Camera Tracker Effect
 
To apply the 3D camera tracker effect, you need to have a footage layer selected in your composition. Then, you can either choose Animation > Track Camera from the menu bar, or choose Track Camera from the layer context menu, or choose Effect > Perspective > 3D Camera Tracker from the effect menu.
 
After applying the effect, you will see a banner on your footage and next to the cancel button that indicates the progress of the analysis and solving phases. These phases are done in the background, so you can work on other parts of your project while they are taking place.
 
## Step 2: Adjust the Settings
 
Once the analysis and solving phases are done, you will see small colored x's on your footage that represent the 3D solved track points. These points are used to place content into the scene.

You can adjust some settings of the effect in the effect controls panel, such as:
 
- Shot Type: This determines whether your footage was shot with a fixed angle of view or a variable zoom. Choose Fixed Angle of View for most cases, unless you have zoomed in or out during your shot.
- Solve Method: This determines how the effect solves for the camera motion. Choose Auto Detect for most cases, unless you have specific knowledge about your shot. You can also choose between Typical and Detailed Analysis for more accuracy.
- Show Track Points: This allows you to show or hide the track points on your footage. You can also filter them by confidence level or by size.
- Target Size: This controls the size of the target that appears when you hover over three neighboring track points. The target size also affects the default size of text and solid layers that you create using the context menu commands.

## Step 3: Attach Content to the Scene
 
To attach content to the scene, you need to select one or more track points that define a best-fit plane for your content. You can do this by drawing a marquee-selection box around multiple track points, or by hovering over three neighboring unselected track points until a semitransparent triangle appears between them.
 
A red target will appear, showing the orientation of the plane in 3D space. You can drag the center of the target to move it to a different location if needed.
 
Then, right-click above the selection or target, and choose the type of content that you want to create from the context menu. You can create:

- Text: This creates a text layer with its anchor point at the center of the target.
- Solid: This creates a solid layer with its anchor point at the center of the target.
- Null: This creates a null layer with its anchor point at the center of the target. You can use this as a parent for other layers that you want to attach to the scene.
- Text/Solid/Null for each selected point: This creates a text/solid/null layer for each selected track point with its anchor point at that point.
- Create Shadow Catcher: This creates a solid layer that accepts shadows only from other layers in your scene. This helps to create realistic shadows for your 3D elements. Note that this also creates a light if one does not exist in your composition.

## Tips and Tricks
 
Here are some tips and tricks to get better results with the 3D camera tracker effect:

- Moving objects can confuse the 3D camera tracker effect, as it can interpret points for stationary objects close to the camera as moving due to parallax. To avoid this, you can delete bad or unwanted points by selecting them and pressing Delete.
