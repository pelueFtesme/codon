Sentemul is a software that can emulate SuperPro dongles, which are hardware devices that protect software from unauthorized copying or use. Sentemul can create a virtual dongle that mimics the original one, allowing you to run the protected software without the physical device. However, Sentemul 64 bit is not compatible with some dump files created by other tools, such as Edgespro11 or HaspHL2007. In this article, we will show you how to use Sentemul 64 bit to emulate SuperPro dongles on Windows 7 64 bit, Windows Vista 64 bit, or Windows XP 64 bit.
 
## Requirements
 
- A SuperPro dongle or a dump file (.dng or .dmp) of it.
- A 32 bit operating system (OS) where you can run Sentemul2007 or HaspHL2007.
- A 64 bit OS where you want to use Sentemul 64 bit.
- The following programs: Sentemul2007, Sentemul 64 bit, MultiKeyEmu x64 v. 0.18.0.3, dmp2mkey v 2.3, PVA v 3.3, Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider, and the latest Sentinel Drivers.

## Steps

1. If you have a SuperPro dongle, plug it into your computer and use PVA v 3.3 to dump its data into a .dmp file. If you already have a .dng file, skip this step.
2. In your 32 bit OS, run Sentemul2007 or HaspHL2007 and install the driver. Then load your .dng or .dmp file and start the service. This will emulate your dongle in the 32 bit OS.
3. Still in your 32 bit OS, run dmp2mkey v 2.3 and use it to convert your .dng or .dmp file into a .reg file. This file contains the registry entries that will be used by Sentemul 64 bit in your 64 bit OS.
4. Move to your 64 bit OS and install the latest Sentinel Drivers. These are required for Sentemul 64 bit to work.
5. Create a new folder in your 64 bit OS, for example C:\\MultiKey. Copy the MultiKeyEmu x64 v. 0.18.0.3 files into this folder.
6. Install the .reg file that you created in step 3 by double-clicking on it and selecting âto regâ or right-clicking on it and choosing "Merge". This will add the registry entries for Sentemul 64 bit.
7. Run Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider and use it to disable driver signing enforcement and sign the multikey.sys driver file that is located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\multikey.sys. This is necessary because Windows does not allow unsigned drivers to be installed.
8. Run install.cmd from the MultiKey folder and follow the instructions to install Sentemul 64 bit.
9. Restart your computer and enjoy your emulated dongle!

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have the correct version of Sentemul for your OS (32 bit or 64 bit).
- Make sure you have the latest version of Sentinel Drivers installed.
- Make sure you have disabled driver signing enforcement and signed the multikey.sys driver file with Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider.
- Make sure you have installed the .reg file correctly and that it matches your dongle type and serial number.
- Make sure you have copied all the files from MultiKeyEmu x64 v. 0.18.0.3 into the MultiKey folder and run install.cmd as administrator.
- If you have any other dongle emulators installed, uninstall them before using Sentemul 64 bit.
