# Spatial Manager for AutoCAD: How to Crack and Activate It
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD is a powerful tool that allows you to import, export, and manage spatial data in AutoCAD. It supports many formats and coordinate systems, and lets you perform spatial queries, transformations, and thematic maps. However, it is not a free software and requires a license to use it fully.

Spatial Manager for AutoCAD has many features and functions that can help you work with spatial data in AutoCAD. Some of the main ones are:

- Import and export spatial data from various sources, such as shapefiles, KML, CSV, GeoJSON, SQLite, PostGIS, and more.
- Manage the data properties, such as layer name, color, line type, fill type, transparency, labels, and data tables.
- Perform spatial operations, such as clipping, cropping, splitting, merging, buffering, and dissolving.
- Convert between different coordinate systems and projections.
- Create thematic maps based on data attributes or expressions.
- Use spatial queries to filter and select data based on spatial or attribute criteria.

To use Spatial Manager for AutoCAD, you will need to have AutoCAD installed on your computer. Spatial Manager for AutoCAD is compatible with AutoCAD versions from 2008 to 2022. You will also need to have a valid license for Spatial Manager for AutoCAD or use a trial version for 30 days.
 
To start using Spatial Manager for AutoCAD, you will need to load it in AutoCAD. You can do this by typing "SPM" in the command line or clicking on the Spatial Manager icon in the ribbon. This will open the Spatial Manager palette, where you can access all the functions and options of the program.

In this article, we will show you how to use some of the basic features of Spatial Manager for AutoCAD. We will use a sample data set of US states and counties, which you can download from here.
 
## Importing Spatial Data
 
To import spatial data into AutoCAD, you can use the Import function in the Spatial Manager palette. You can also use the "SPMIMPORT" command or the "Import" button in the ribbon. This will open a dialog box where you can select the source and format of the data you want to import.

In our example, we will import a shapefile of US states. We will select the file "US\_States.shp" from our download folder and click on "Open". This will show us a preview of the data and some options to customize the import process. We can change the layer name, color, line type, fill type, transparency, and labels of the imported data. We can also choose to import the data as polylines or polygons, and to create a data table with the attributes of the data.
 
We will leave the default options and click on "Import". This will import the data into AutoCAD and create a new layer called "US\_States". We can see the imported data in the drawing area and in the Layers panel.
 
## Exporting Spatial Data
 
To export spatial data from AutoCAD, you can use the Export function in the Spatial Manager palette. You can also use the "SPMEXPORT" command or the "Export" button in the ribbon. This will open a dialog box where you can select the destination and format of the data you want to export.
 
In our example, we will export a subset of US counties as a KML file. We will select some counties from Texas using the Select tool in AutoCAD. Then we will click on the Export button and choose "KML" as the format. This will show us some options to customize the export process. We can change the file name, location, coordinate system, and attributes of the exported data. We can also choose to export the data as points, lines, or polygons.
 
We will leave the default options and click on "Export". This will export the selected data as a KML file called "Texas\_Counties.kml" in our download folder. We can open this file in Google Earth or any other program that supports KML files.
