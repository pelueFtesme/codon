## What are the main components of the Siemens Siremobil Compact L C-arm?
  
The Siemens Siremobil Compact L C-arm consists of four main components: the C-arm, the X-ray generator/tube, the X-ray image intensifier, and the TV system. Each component has its own specifications and functions that need to be checked and calibrated during service.
  
- The C-arm is the part that holds the X-ray tube and the image intensifier. It allows for orbital movement, angulation, horizontal movement, immersion depth, swivel range, and vertical travel. The C-arm should be inspected for any mechanical damage or wear and tear, and its movements should be smooth and precise.
- The X-ray generator/tube is the part that produces the X-rays that pass through the patient's body and create an image on the image intensifier. It has a converter control frequency, a KV range, a fluoroscopy mode, a digital radiography mode, and a cassette exposure mode. The X-ray generator/tube should be tested for its output voltage, current, waveform, stability, linearity, and dose rate. The X-ray tube should also be checked for its focal spot size, anode angle, filtration, and cooling system.
- The X-ray image intensifier is the part that converts the X-rays into visible light that can be displayed on a monitor. It has a metal-enamel or metal-ceramic technology, a nominal diameter, a zoom format, a grid, an input screen, an output screen, an input window, and an electron optics system. The X-ray image intensifier should be evaluated for its resolution, contrast, distortion, brightness gain, lag time, vignetting, noise level, and alignment.
- The TV system is the part that processes and displays the image from the image intensifier. It has a VIDEOMED DC with CCD sensor, a TV standard, a digital image rotation function, an X-ray image intensifier interface board (XIB), a video processor board (VPB), a monitor interface board (MIB), and a monitor. The TV system should be verified for its signal quality, synchronization, geometry, color balance, brightness level, contrast level,
