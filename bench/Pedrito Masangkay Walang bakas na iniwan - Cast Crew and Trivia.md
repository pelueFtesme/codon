The film begins with Pedrito Masangkay (Ian Veneracion) executing a hit on a politician who is involved in a drug deal. He then meets his girlfriend Charing (Cristina Gonzales), who works as a waitress in a bar. Pedrito tells her that he wants to quit his job as a hitman and start a new life with her. He also reveals that he has a son named Boyong (Ben Sagmit) from his previous marriage with Emily (Dexter Doria), who died in a car accident.
 
Meanwhile, Pedrito's former boss Sarmiento (Dick Israel), who runs a crime syndicate, is furious that Pedrito has betrayed him and stolen his money. He orders his men to find and kill Pedrito. He also hires Jennifer (Beth Tamayo), a nurse who works in the same hospital where Pedrito's son is being treated for leukemia. Jennifer blames Pedrito for the death of her brother Santos (Michael Alano), who was one of Pedrito's victims. She agrees to help Sarmiento in exchange for money to pay for her brother's funeral.
 
Pedrito and Charing decide to leave the city and go to Pedrito's uncle's farm in the province. However, they are followed by Sarmiento's men and Capt. Briones (Andy Poe), a corrupt police officer who is also after Pedrito. A shootout ensues, resulting in the death of several of Sarmiento's men and Briones' partner Torres (Karen Timbol). Pedrito and Charing manage to escape and reach the farm, where they are welcomed by Pedrito's uncle Robert (Robert Talby) and his wife Caridad (Perla Bautista).
 
However, their peace is short-lived as Jennifer tracks them down and informs Sarmiento and Briones of their location. She also kidnaps Boyong from the hospital and brings him to Sarmiento's hideout. Sarmiento calls Pedrito and tells him that he has his son and demands that he surrender himself or else he will kill him. Pedrito agrees to meet Sarmiento at an abandoned warehouse, where he plans to rescue his son and confront his enemies.
 
Will Pedrito be able to save his son and escape from his past? Will he be able to start a new life with Charing? Will Jennifer get her revenge on Pedrito? Find out in Pedrito Masangkay: Walang bakas na iniwan, a Filipino action crime thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
